    <string name="hWDescription">It is well known how OCD works within each patient, as you read above first begins with a thought, an idea or an image that appears intrusively and that clearly the person with OCD does not want it or identify with it, this whole situation generates a lot of stress, anxiety, insecurity and discomfort in the person, all this leads the person to perform a series of actions (or thoughts) called rituals which counteract for a short period of time these negative feelings of anxiety, but in reality in the long term these compulsions make the problem bigger, as they increase the symptoms of OCD.\n\n
                    For example, a person with germ OCD has intrusive ideas, thoughts or images that everything is full of germs, so they will feel very insecure, anxious and uncomfortable, then to counteract these symptoms they will begin to wash their hands much more frequently and also stop going to certain places which they believe are contaminated, thus forming a cycle in which the person will not improve unless they stop doing these compulsions and confront their obsessions.</string>

    <string name="question_info">OCD is a mental condition characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsions that occupy at least an hour a day, but usually more, and cause significant distress
                    Obsessions are usually persistent and uncontrollable thoughts, images or ideas that appear intrusively, these obsessions are unwanted and cause a lot of discomfort.  These thoughts also cause anxiety and discomfort that significantly interfere with normal life. Following these thoughts, the person with OCD performs a series of actions in order to counteract the discomfort, which actually increases the symptoms of OCD.
                    All people have intrusive thoughts throughout the day, but a person who does not have OCD is able to filter out recurring thoughts about germs, for example.  But people with OCD who are obsessed with germs cannot stop thinking about being contaminated and may even avoid entering public places.</string>
